# Adopt A Drain
Adopt A Drain is a community driven program for maintaining, reporting and cleaning storm drains. 
Storm drains help protect neighborhoods against flooding, but they also flow into local lakes, carrying litter and debris off the street. Some storm drains can get clogged by mud, sediment or debris, causing flooding in the surrounding area of the neighborhood or street. You can make a difference by volunteering 15 minutes of your time to search for a drain to adopt and report if there is any damage or any potential harmful chemicals flowing through the drain and maintaining it clean. Adopt a storm drain today to help protect our water and keep our neighborhoods clean.
